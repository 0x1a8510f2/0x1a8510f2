## Hi there ðŸŒŠ!

I'm 0x1a8510f2 (read: [Dave](https://matrix.to/#/!tgDWJZIiwNLhwJzccm:matrix.org/$8ex3Kfta_gtnLGIiiefg-v_HryRe-BzK_NbsTQFyu-k?via=l1qu1d.net&via=mozilla.org&via=geraghty.london)). I currently reside somewhere in the ether (it's a decent song too). This profile contains a range of my work, mostly completed for fun with my community hat on (I sometimes wear other hats; my favourite is grey), which means that much of my work is freely available under a variety of open-source licenses. Feel free to look around, or read on for a summary of what I've been up to.

## Interesting Projects ðŸš§

- [**Wraith**](https://dev.l1qu1d.net/wraith-labs/wraith) - A remote admin framework which I've been working on for a while. The aim is to make a RAT which is so flexible it's effectively unstoppable, given the right modules. For education, duck hunting, and home defense only; naturally.
- [**Syphon**](https://syphon.org) - A Matrix client with emphasis on privacy and security as well as ease of use. This isn't my own project, but I can often be found hanging around in the Syphon support channels, contributing translations and code, or helping out with the community.
- [**Matrix.org Security**](https://matrix.org/security-disclosure-policy) - Sometimes, despite being on the red team, one has to take the blue pill and dive deeper into the Matrix to find out how deep the rabbit hole goes. Deep enough, it turns out, to find a few bugs.
- [**In-Browser Go Compiler (IBGC)**](https://github.com/0x1a8510f2/IBGC) - A (now-archived) project of mine to get a Go compiler working in the browser. In the end I succeeded, but I no longer had a use-case for the project, which led me to archive it before it saw enough features and polish to be useful. That said, the repository remains accessible as a resource for anyone wishing to replicate or improve this project, though many like it are now available (and, as far as I know, it wasn't the first either).
